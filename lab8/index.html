    <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2><pre>
    We were asked to create a set of anonymous
    functions and callbacks. The first set of
    functions gave back a string in console
    that proved that each function worked. In the
    second set of functions, we used a callback function
    to nest an anoynous function that used our earlier
    functions. Then we staggered the timing for the last
    set of functions.
    </pre>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <pre>
    I still struggle with the logic behind functions.
    A lot of it is still unclear to me. But I was able to
    follow along using the code that was given in the Lab.
    </pre>
    <h2>Results</h2><pre>
    The results are in the console.
    The wording is a bit different from the lab example,
    but the funcitons work and perform the same.
