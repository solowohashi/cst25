      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <pre>
          This lab asked us to create a new lab
          folder and incorporate Functions into
          the Results section. We were also asked
          to link a CSS document to the HTML.
        </pre>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <pre>
          I'm still struggling with
          understanding Javascript.The problem solving
          behind it feels unnatural.
          Where HTML is reflected in the visual
          output, Javascript seems to contain a lot
          of nuance that I haven't been able to
          understand.
        </pre>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      The results are present on this webpage and below the Script Output heading.
